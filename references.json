Peptide-centric local stability assay (PELSA) is a powerful tool for detecting these interactions and localizing potential binding sites. However, its original workflow is limited in throughput, sample compatibility and accessible protein targets. Here, we introduce a high-throughput adaptation - HT-PELSA - that increases sample processing efficiency 100-fold while maintaining high sensitivity and reproducibility. HT-PELSA substantially extends the capabilities of the original method by enabling sensitive protein-ligand profiling in crude cell, tissue and bacterial lysates, making it possible to identify membrane protein targets in diverse biological systems. We demonstrate that HT-PELSA can precisely and accurately determine binding affinities of small molecule inhibitors, sensitively detect direct and allosteric ATP binding, and reveal off-target interactions of a marketed kinase inhibitor in heart tissue. By enhancing scalability, reducing costs, and enabling system-wide drug screening across a wide range of sample types, HT-PELSA - when combined with next-generation mass spectrometry - offers a powerful platform poised to accelerate both drug discovery and basic biological research.</jats:p>",

A comparison of cAMP levels was performed for ADCY5 wild-type and R418W mutant cells. ADCY5-catalyzed cAMP production was reduced with all three purine derivatives, while the most pronounced effects on cAMP reduction were observed for ADCY5 R418W mutant cells. The gain-of-function ADCY5 R418W mutant is characterized by an increased catalytic activity resulting in elevated cAMP levels that cause kinetic disorders or dyskinesia in patients. Based on our findings in ADCY5 cells, a slow-release formulation of theophylline was administered to a preschool-aged patient with ADCY5-related dyskinesia. A striking improvement of symptoms was observed, outperforming the effects of caffeine that had previously been administered to the same patient. We suggest considering theophylline as an alternative therapeutic option to treat ADCY5-related dyskinesia in patients.</jats:p>",
