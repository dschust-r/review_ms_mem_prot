### Accessibility approaches

[@DOI:10.1007/978-1-0716-3397-7_13; @DOI:10.1101/2025.04.28.650974; @DOI:10.7554/eLife.77032; @DOI:10.1073/pnas.2300309120; @DOI:10.1038/s44319-024-00076-y; @DOI:10.1038/s41592-024-02553-7; @DOI:10.1002/anie.202424779]

Accessibility approaches use chemical modifications or limited proteolysis to investigate solvent-exposed regions of proteins. Changes in surface accessibility can be interpreted as conformational changes, protein interactions or effects of ligand binding. A key strength of these approaches is their applicability to low- and high-complexity samples. However, in commonly used cell lysates, the samples are usually centrifuged prior to the experiment to remove unbroken cells and debris. This process also removes membrane fragments, resulting in a bias towards identifying soluble proteins. Adapted protocols have been developed to investigate changes in the accessibility of membrane proteins in either purified or native lipid environments.
Limited Proteolysis Coupled to Mass Spectrometry (LiP-MS) employs the broad-specificity protease proteinase K (PK) in a pulse-proteolysis approach to probe structural changes in proteins. Because PK cleaves accessible, flexible regions, changes in proteolytic patterns can reveal conformational shifts in response to perturbations. This method has been applied to purified proteins, membrane-enriched fractions, and even crude lysates [@DOI:10.1007/978-1-0716-3397-7_13].
For example, in a study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cya, an enzyme involved in cAMP production, LiP-MS was used to characterize mutations within its intracellular binding pocket (Ec1). The results revealed altered protease accessibility and dynamics in the helical domain, providing structural insight into the effects of these mutations [@DOI:10.7554/eLife.77032]. In another application, LiP-MS was performed on detergent-free native bovine rod outer segment membranes to investigate regulation of the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel by the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). The approach identified CaM-binding sites on the CNG channel and confirmed the formation of a ternary complex betweem the two CNG subunits and CaM [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.2300309120]. Additionally, LiP-MS was used to analyze crude mammalian cell membranes, revealing that flexible domains are critical for modulating adenylate cyclase 8 (AC8) activity through interactions with CaM and G-proteins (Gα and Gβγ) [@DOI:10.1038/s44319-024-00076-y].
Like LiP-MS, the Peptide-Centric Local Stability Assay (PELSA) also utilizes pulse-proteolysis to detect protein–ligand interactions. Instead of proteinase K, PELSA employs high concentrations of trypsin to probe accessibility of proteins[@DOI:10.1038/s41592-024-02553-7]. While the original PELSA workflow required centrifuged lysates to avoid filter clogging, a high-throughput variant (HT-PELSA) overcomes this limitation by using C18 plates for protein removal, allowing direct application to crude lysates from a range of sources, including cell lines, tissues, and bacteria. This adaptation broadens the method’s applicability, including to membrane-associated proteins. For example, HT-PELSA successfully identified the primary target BCR-ABL1 as well as several known membrane-related off-targets upon dasatinib treatment. In another case, application to ampicillin-treated E. coli lysates revealed five established antibiotic targets, demonstrating the method’s utility also in microbial systems [@DOI:10.1101/2025.04.28.650974].
While protease-based methods such as LiP-MS and PELSA rely on differential cleavage to infer structural accessibility, other strategies use chemical labeling to probe solvent-exposed regions. Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins (FPOP) uses hydroxyl radicals to label solvent-exposed amino acids but traditionally requires detergent purification, disrupting native environments. While in-cell FPOP avoids detergents, water-soluble hydroxyl radicals provide poor transmembrane domain coverage. IC-FPOMP (in-cell fast photochemical oxidation of membrane proteins) addresses this using TiO₂ nanoparticles to generate reactive oxygen species near plasma membranes, improving transmembrane domain labeling in intact cells. For instance, IC-FPOMP was applied to the human glucose transporter GLUT1—an essential membrane protein in erythrocytes, the blood–brain barrier, and cancer cells. Comparisons between liposomal and native cellular membranes revealed conformation-dependent differences, highlighting how membrane composition can influence GLUT1 structure and dynamics. Moreover, IC-FPOMP enabled in-cell drug screening against GLUT1, revealing distinct protein painting on ligand binding [@DOI:10.1002/anie.202424779].


### Thermal proteome profiling
Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) is a technique used to detect changes in protein thermal stability upon perturbations such as ligand binding. When combined with quantitative mass spectrometry, TPP enables the identification of drug–target interactions directly in cell lysates or intact cells. Using TPP in detergent-containing lysates, the small molecule indophagolin —an activator of starvation-induced autophagy— was found to alter the thermal stability of 26 proteins. Among these, the purinergic receptor P2X4 was identified as the primary target. This study provided the first direct evidence linking P2X4 to autophagy, showing that indophagolin acts as a P2X4 antagonist [@DOI: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2021.02.017].
To enhance resolution at the plasma membrane, a variant known as Cell Surface TPP (CS-TPP) was developed by integrating classical TPP with selective enrichment of biotinylated, surface-accessible proteins. For example, the action of the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, was examined using this method. While conventional TPP failed to detect its canonical target, CS-TPP successfully identified the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and revealed additional proteins potentially involved in its function or affected by off-target effects. The method has also been applied to investigate copper-induced cellular stress, identifying transporters associated with the high copper response, and to study T-cell receptor remodeling upon antibody engagement [@DOI: 10.1038/s41592-020-01022-1].

### Chemical cross-linking

Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is a technique used to discover and characterize protein–protein interactions. The principle involves the application of chemical compounds that covalently link specific functional groups on proteins via a spacer arm. The readouts from XL-MS experiments include intraprotein crosslinks (intralinks), which occur within a single protein, and interprotein crosslinks, which connect different proteins and provide spatial constraints.
XL-MS has been traditionally applied to proteins in low-complexity environments—such as membrane proteins solubilized in detergent—due to technical challenges in more native contexts. This approach can be informative when interactions occur in flexible or dynamic protein regions that are difficult to resolve using classical structural biology techniques. For example, XL-MS has been used to infer the binding sites of calmodulin (CaM) on the CNG channel [@DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2300309120], providing insight into interactions not easily resolved by cryo-EM. It also identified interaction sites of multiple AC8 binding partners, allowing the mapping of their spatial arrangement and about potential mechanisms of action [@DOI: 10.1038/s44319-024-00076-y]. In another case, while structural studies could not resolve how SNARE proteins inhibit the sodium leak channel NALCN, XL-MS directly pinpointed a specific SNARE-binding region on NALCN [@DOI:10.1126/sciadv.ads6004].
While crosslinking in purified systems is important for mapping protein interaction interfaces, the loss of the native membrane environment during purification can alter protein conformation and binding behavior. Recent approaches have focused on applying XL-MS directly to membrane proteins within their native lipid context. By using plasma membrane enrichment strategies, in situ interaction maps of the membranome have been reported, capturing proximity relationships within the membrane. Known membrane protein as the P-type ATPases and ABC transporters were detected alongside previously uncharacterized proximal proteins, which may represent novel interaction partners requiring further validation [@DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-4298-6_16].
 Beyond the plasma membrane, XL-MS has also been applied to investigate organelle-specific membrane topologies. One such approach, crosslink-assisted spatial proteomics (CLASP), combines organelle enrichment with crosslinking to explore the local membranome. Applied to mitochondria, this method identified 58 membrane-associated proteins. By analyzing crosslinks to known sub-compartment markers, CLASP provided insights into the spatial organization and membrane topology within mitochondrial substructures [@DOI: 10.1038/s41467-024-47569-x]. Next to membrane and organelle enrichment strategies, newer approaches have expanded XL-MS using unconventional crosslinking chemistries. One such method targets glycan-mediated interactions by labeling surface glycans with azido groups and crosslinking them to nearby primary amines. This enables identification of glycan-dependent crosslinks, providing insights into glycosylation sites, glycoforms, and interaction patterns on both the extracellular and cytosolic faces of membranes. Using this strategy, interaction networks involving glycosylated integrins, aminopeptidase N, and lysosome-associated membrane proteins have been described [@DOI: 10.1039/d1sc00814e].
Overall, XL-MS complements classical structural methods by capturing protein–protein interactions in flexible or dynamic regions. In complex biological systems such as the plasma membrane or organelles, it enables the mapping of interaction hubs and characterization of membrane-associated proteins. Emerging chemistries, including glycan-targeted crosslinking, further broaden its utility by revealing modification-dependent interactions.

##Crosslink-Guided Modeling of Protein Structures
Beyond identifying interaction partners and mapping topologies, XL-MS data can also be integrated into structural modeling workflows to refine or predict protein complex architectures. Crosslink-derived distance restraints are increasingly used to guide docking and structural modeling, especially for membrane proteins where experimental structures remain limited. Tools such as HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven Biomolecular DOCKing) enable the incorporation of crosslinking data to model protein–protein interactions with higher spatial accuracy.
For example, docking guided by XL-MS and further analyzed with DisVis revealed three distinct interfaces between COX and AIFM1, enabling the modeling of a COX–AIFM1 complex. This provided insight into how AIFM1 may insert into the inner mitochondrial membrane and suggested potential functional implications [@DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2106950118]. More recently, crosslinking data have also been integrated with AlphaFold3 predictions for membrane protein predictions (AF3x). In the case of the SLC19A3 transporter, AlphaFold3 alone incorrectly predicted the complex with a nanobody in its inward-open state, whereas the inclusion of crosslinking restraints led to a model more consistent with the experimentally resolved cryo-EM structure [@DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.03.626671].
Altogether, crosslink-guided modeling provides a bridge between experimental data and structural prediction. Especially for membrane proteins—where high-resolution structures remain scarce—it offers a way to build and test mechanistic hypotheses grounded in experimental proximity data.
