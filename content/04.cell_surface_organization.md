## 3. Mass spectrometry reveals the cell surface organization  {.page_break_before}
Introduction
Protein associations at the cell surface, whether direct interactions or colocalization, are essential for a wide range of cellular processes, including signaling, adhesion, and immune regulation [@DOI:10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.09.020]. 
For example, large macromolecular complexes like the T-cell receptor rely on the precise coordination of multiple interacting proteins to function properly. 
Disruption or dysregulation of these native protein associations can lead to disease, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. 
Defining the molecular architecture of the cell surface and understanding how these protein interactions drive function is therefore a critical goal in cell biology and biomedical research. Mass spectrometry-based approaches, which offer a powerful and unbiased way to map these complex networks, have emerged as key tools to reveal the organization and composition of the cell surface proteome. 
In this section, we highlight recent studies that leverage mass spectrometry and complementary methods to probe the dynamic landscape of cell surface protein interactions and shed light on their roles in health and disease.

Proximity labeling

One of the most widely used approaches for studying the architecture of the cell surface proteome is proximity labeling, a suite of techniques that have emerged over the past decade [@DOI:10.1021/acs.chemrev.4c00554]. 
These methods rely on the generation of short-lived reactive intermediates, typically derived from biotin, which covalently label proteins in close proximity to a protein of interest. 
Initially developed for intracellular protein mapping, proximity labeling has since been successfully adapted to investigate interaction networks at the cell surface [@DOI:10.3390/cancers17020179].
A major early breakthrough in applying proximity labeling to map cell surface interactions came from Li et al., who used the technique to study cluster antigens associated with the B cell receptor (BCR) [@DOI:10.1074/jbc.M113.529578]. 
This study introduced the SPPLAT (Selective Proteomic Proximity Labeling Assay using Tyramide) method, which enabled mapping of the BCR’s molecular neighborhood. 
To catalyze the labeling reaction, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was conjugated directly to a primary antibody targeting the BCR. 
Quantitative analysis was performed using SILAC-based heavy isotope labeling, with comparisons made to a non-targeted isotype control. 
Since BCR signaling depends on protein clustering to initiate downstream signaling, this system was well-suited to identify proximal interactors. 
Upon BCR crosslinking via a bivalent anti-IgM antibody, the authors identified 12 enriched proteins, 6 of which had not been previously linked to the BCR complex. 
Follow-up experiments confirmed BCR localization to lipid rafts and validated chB6, a chicken allotypic marker, as a novel accessory protein in the BCR signaling microenvironment.

Another example of using cell surface proximity labeling to uncover biological networks comes from two studies focused on mapping the interaction network of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
In one, Al Mismar et al. engineered the BirA enzyme TurboID [@DOI:10.1038/nbt.4201] to develop an approach for extracellular proximity labeling [@DOI:10.1126/scisignal.adl6164]. 
To enable extracellular expression of TurboID, they fused an N-terminal signal sequence from immunoglobulin kappa to the construct, enriching for cell surface proteins. 
When fused to five type I transmembrane proteins, including EGFR, this construct enabled profiling and comparison of their interactomes, revealing striking differences among all baits except for EGFR and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2). 
Importantly, the authors created constructs of EGFR with TurboID fused to both the N- and C-termini, and tested the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation at two concentrations to identify changes in the extracellular and intracellular interactomes. 
They found that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) was specifically relocalized to interact with EGFR upon EGF stimulation. 
This study leveraged cell surface protein engineering and proximity labeling proteomics to identify a novel EGFR interaction partner.
In the second EGFR study, Lin et al. used MultiMap, an Eosin Y photocatalyzed proximity labeling reaction, to map the proximal interactome of EGFR at different labeling radii [@DOI:10.1126/science.adl5763]. 
Using three reactive probes, diazirine biotin, aryl azide biotin, and biotin phenol, they took advantage of their distinct reactive intermediate half-lives to generate an interaction map with varying resolution. 
This approach revealed 16 proteins enriched by all three labeling reagents, including CD44 and Galectin-3, which had not previously been linked to EGFR. These findings were further validated using structural modeling of heterodimeric interactions with AlphaFold-Multimer. 
In a follow-up study, the same group used MultiMap to profile EGFR interactors at different time points after EGF-induced activation [@DOI:10.1101/2024.12.21.629933]. 
By tagging EGFR with a FLAG epitope at the N-terminus and a HaloTag at the C-terminus, they captured both extracellular and intracellular interactomes. Comparing the interactome after 5 and 60 minutes of EGF treatment allowed them to distinguish early versus late binding events. 
While some proteins remained associated at both time points, many showed dynamic changes in binding. 
Together, these studies highlight the unique capabilities of proximity labeling to capture spatial and temporal changes in surface protein interaction networks.
As an alternative to profiling cell surface interactions by attaching a catalyst to an endogenous protein, Joeh et al. used an exogenously added APEX2–galectin-3 fusion protein to identify galectin ligands and map their interactome [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.2009206117]. 
They applied this approach using both full-length galectin-3 and a truncated version lacking the N-terminal domain to investigate its role in surface protein oligomerization. 
This analysis revealed that galectin-3 bound to proteins from diverse families, including integrins (ITGA1, ITGB1) and tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, TSPAN6). 
The authors further validated these interactions by estimating binding affinities for a selected subset of targets. 
To explore the glycan context of these interactions, they used glycomics to characterize the glycans expressed by their cell line, then repeated the experiment in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to identify interactors in primary human cells.
In a follow-up study, Vilen et al. used an APEX2–galectin-1 fusion to profile galectin-1 ligands and map its interactome on muscle stem cells [@DOI:10.1021/acschembio.1c00313]. 
They found that fusing APEX2 to the N-terminus of galectin-1 preserved its native binding properties. 
Using an optimized workflow, the researchers identified CD44 as a galectin-1 interactor and confirmed that this interaction depended on the N-linked glycosylation of CD44. 
Together, these studies demonstrate the value of using an exogenously applied protein of interest to probe surface protein interactions. A similar approach was recently used by Critcher et al., who applied an APEX2 fusion to map the interactome of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) on the cell surface [@DOI:10.1021/acschembio.4c00475].
To date, the most comprehensive mapping of the cell surface proteome was conducted by Floyd et al. [@DOI:10.1101/2025.02.12.637979]. 
In this study, the authors applied proximity labeling using both SPPLAT and µMap across 65 antigens on Jurkat T lymphocyte cells and 20 antigens on Daudi B lymphoblast cells. 
The goal was to assemble a detailed and large-scale map of the human cell surface proteome. Unlike most proximity labeling studies, which typically use a bait-centric approach, this work employed a prey-centric analytical framework to identify and visualize the surface proteome. 
The researchers demonstrated the validity of their strategy by showing that known protein complexes, such as the T-cell receptor (TCR), formed distinct and functionally meaningful clusters on the surface of Jurkat cells.
Importantly, the study found that among the 70 proteins expressed on the surfaces of Jurkat and Daudi cells, interactions were largely conserved. This was evidenced by high pairwise Pearson correlation values across the two cell types. 
To uncover functional associations among surface proteins, the team trained a machine learning classifier on the Jurkat dataset to predict protein–protein associations. 
Using this model, they identified and experimentally validated a functional interaction between the IL10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB) and the interferon alpha receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2). 
Because of the scale and resolution of the proximity labeling data, the researchers were also able to generate three-dimensional models of protein distributions across the cell surfaces of the studied lines. 
Altogether, this work represents the first system-wide, spatially resolved map of the cell surface proteome in any biological context.  

Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS)

Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), which involves the chemical linking of proteins prior to mass spectrometry analysis, has emerged as a valuable method for studying the organization of the cell surface proteome. 
A range of crosslinkers are available, differing in both their reactive groups and spacer arm lengths, allowing for flexibility in targeting specific interactions. 
Current strategies include linking proteins through backbone labeling, such as NHS ester or carboxylic acid chemistry, as well as covalently labeling glycans. 
This technique has proven useful for identifying protein–protein and protein–glycan interaction interfaces, providing high-resolution insights into the structural organization and connectivity of the cell surface proteome.
An illustrative example of cell surface protein–protein crosslinking comes from the work of Armony et al., who studied interactions involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II complexes [@DOI:10.1016/j.molimm.2021.05.010]. 
These complexes present peptide antigens for recognition by T cells, playing a central role in immune surveillance. 
The researchers used the NHS ester crosslinker disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), combined with a membrane fractionation protocol, to crosslink surface proteins on JY cells. 
Crosslinked peptides were enriched using strong cation exchange pre-fractionation, resulting in the identification of over 300 unique crosslinks among 317 surface proteins. 
Notably, 100 of these crosslinks involved HLA class I or II proteins. Among the identified interactions, crosslinks between HLA-I and transferrin receptor (TFRC) or LAT1 were structurally modeled to validate their interface locations. 
By analyzing isoform-specific peptides, the authors confirmed interactions among different HLA-I paralogs, supporting the hypothesis that HLA molecules form clusters on the cell surface. 
The authors further provided evidence that HLA-II complexes interact with HLA-I complexes by interacting with both the HLA proteins and the beta-2 microglobulin (β2M) subunit. 
Structural modeling of the crosslink sites on HLA-II revealed that all sites were localized to one side of the complex, suggesting a defined interaction interface. This study provides a high-resolution map of HLA complex interactions and underscores the utility of crosslinking for dissecting cell surface organization.
While the previous study focused on protein–protein crosslinking, Xie et al. applied a protein–glycan crosslinking approach to probe the cell surface interactome [@DOI:10.1039/D1SC00814E]. 
Their strategy involved metabolically incorporating N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz) into cell surface glycoproteins bearing sialic acids. 
The introduction of an NHS–cyclooctyne crosslinker enabled covalent linkage between sialic acids and nearby primary amines on protein N-termini or lysine residues. 
Using this method, the authors profiled the interactome of PNT2 cells, which express highly sialylated glycoproteins, and identified over 300 glycoprotein-protein interactions. 
Notably, approximately half of the proteins linked via sialic acids were involved in cell adhesion or migration, compared to just 12% of the proteins labeled through NHS chemistry alone. 
This suggests a specific role for sialylated glycans in mediating adhesive and migratory functions. 
The study also explored how core fucosylation affected interactions, finding that the presence of core fucose likely enhanced inter-protein associations. 
Finally, modeling of the glycosylation site on ITGB1 allowed the authors to propose its involvement in stabilizing the ITGAV–ITGB1–RAP1B complex. 
Together, these results provide an interactome that integrates glycosylation features into the mapping of the cell surface proteome.
In a follow-up study, Chen et al. employed the same protein–glycan crosslinking strategy but improved peptide recovery by using a new crosslinker containing a biotin handle linked via either a disulfide or photocleavable bond. 
After benchmarking both versions, the disulfide-linked crosslinker proved more effective and was used to validate interactions involving ITGB1 and EGFR. 
The researchers then applied this approach to PNT2 cells, generating an expanded glycan-mediated interactome. 
This analysis revealed a densely connected network surrounding integrin subunits, including known partners such as CD166/ALCAM and laminins A5 and B1. 
Overall, the work highlights the value of incorporating enrichable tags into crosslinkers to enhance the mapping of glycan-mediated surface interactions.
In a study by Sun et al., another glycan-mediated interactome was mapped using a strategy that did not rely on metabolic incorporation of a clickable handle [@DOI:10.1039/D0SC06327D]. 
Instead, the researchers used a membrane-impermeable crosslinker followed by enzymatic oxidation of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues to generate aldehyde groups. 
These aldehydes served as reactive handles for enrichment through hydrazide chemistry. 
Using this method, the authors were able to selectively enrich surface glycoproteins and construct their associated interactomes. 
Among the interactions identified were crosslinked peptides between epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) and CD166. 
This study demonstrates a novel approach for crosslinking and enriching the glycoproteome, offering a complementary strategy for probing surface protein interactions.

Affinity-purification mass spectrometry

Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is one of the most widely used methods for probing direct protein-protein interactions. 
However, its application to membrane protein interactions has been limited due to the harsh detergents required for solubilization [@DOI:10.1038/nprot.2016.140]. 
Despite this challenge, several groups have used AP-MS to study the cell surface interactome. In this section, we highlight recent advances made using this approach.
An important study by Pankow et al. provided a foundational and rigorously optimized protocol for profiling membrane protein interactomes using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) [@DOI:10.1038/nprot.2016.140]. 
Recognizing the unique challenges posed by membrane proteins such as low solubility, susceptibility to aggregation, and sensitivity to detergent conditions, the authors systematically optimized lysis buffers to preserve native interactions while minimizing protein loss. 
Their workflow also emphasized the inclusion of appropriate negative controls and biological replicates to reduce false positives and ensure statistical robustness in downstream analysis. 
Crucially, the protocol introduced strategies for quantitative interpretation of enrichment data, including label-free quantification and statistical scoring models to distinguish specific interactions from background contaminants. 
These methodological refinements greatly improved the sensitivity and reproducibility of membrane protein interactome mapping when tested on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), setting the stage for broader application of AP-MS to cell surface complexes. 
A recent study by Frommelt et al. explored the interactome of the entire solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamily [@DOI:10.1038/s44320-025-00109-1]. 
SLCs are a large family of proteins responsible for transporting biomolecules across cellular membranes, with over 450 members. In this work, the authors generated genetic fusions of 405 SLC proteins with a Strep-tag and overexpressed them in HEK293 cells. 
Using an optimized sample preparation workflow, they enriched over 4,000 prey proteins across 396 SLC baits that passed quality thresholds. 
The resulting data enabled hierarchical clustering of SLCs based on their enrichment profiles, revealing functional groupings within the superfamily. 
To validate the functional relevance of the observed interactions, the authors assessed protein stability for 65 tagged SLCs across more than 100 conditions. 
This revealed a range of phenotypic effects when interacting proteins were either depleted or overexpressed. The study focused on SLC16A6, also known as monocarboxylate transporter 7, to examine the role of its interactors, particularly BTRC and FBXW11, in regulating protein stability. 
By identifying shared consensus sequences, they demonstrated that these sequences matched phosphorylated degrons responsible for protein turnover. 
The authors also examined how depletion of interactors affected the subcellular localization of SLC proteins. Of 132 interactions tested, 59 resulted in localization changes, including a highlighted case involving SLC22A4 and YIPF3. 
Overall, this study provides a comprehensive interactome for the SLC superfamily and demonstrates the utility of AP-MS in uncovering functional membrane protein interactions.

Cell surface thermal proteome profiling

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) has emerged as a powerful method for studying cell surface protein interactions. 
By measuring shifts in protein stability in response to perturbations, TPP enables profiling of how cell surface proteins respond to various ligands or treatments.
In a study by Kalxdorf et al., the authors developed an approach that combines TPP with cell surface protein enrichment (CS-TPP) to monitor the effects of perturbations on surface proteins [@DOI:10.1038/s41592-020-01022-1]. 
Their method involved applying thermal treatment to live cells in the presence or absence of a compound, followed by selective oxidation and biotinylation of surface proteins using an oxime ligation strategy [@DOI:10.1038/nmeth.1305]. 
This workflow was applied across four different cell lines. Using this approach, the researchers observed broad trends, such as solute carriers (SLCs) exhibiting greater thermal stability compared to proteins involved in signaling, migration, and adhesion. 
They then applied the method to examine the impact of ouabain, a cardiac glycoside, on the K562 cell surface proteome. 
Notably, significant changes in the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase complex were only detectable with the CS-TPP workflow, emphasizing the sensitivity of this approach. To investigate changes in the T cell receptor (TCR) complex upon stimulation with CD3 and CD28 antibodies, the authors found that core TCR subunits decreased in abundance. 
A thermal proximity coaggregation analysis further revealed that proteins such as CD6, ORAI1, and SLAMF6 displayed melting behavior more similar to the TCR complex upon stimulation, suggesting functional clustering. 
Finally, the method was used to study how different integrin-targeting compounds affect integrin stability. 
By comparing responses to an ITGAV antibody, the small molecule inhibitor SB273005, and the peptide cyclo-RGDfK, the authors demonstrated that TPP can distinguish between different mechanisms of action. 
Altogether, this work demonstrates the value of TPP in characterizing compound-induced rearrangements in the cell surface proteome and highlights its potential for functional profiling of surface interactions.

Summary

A wide range of approaches have been employed to map the organization and composition of the cell surface proteome, including proximity labeling, crosslinking mass spectrometry, affinity purification, and thermal proteome profiling. 
Each technique offers unique strengths: proximity labeling excels in capturing spatially and temporally resolved interaction networks, crosslinking provides high-resolution structural insights into protein-protein and protein-glycan interfaces, affinity purification enables deep profiling of membrane protein complexes, and thermal proteome profiling detects dynamic rearrangements in response to perturbations. 
Together, these methods have illuminated key aspects of surface protein architecture and function, revealing previously unknown interactors and providing mechanistic insights into signaling, adhesion, and immune regulation. 
Yet despite these advances, our understanding of the cell surface interactome remains incomplete. 
Important questions such as the exact stoichiometries and dynamics of multi-protein complexes are still unresolved. Many interactions remain unvalidated or context-dependent, and challenges persist in resolving transient or low-abundance interactions, particularly in primary cells or tissues. 
As methods continue to evolve and datasets grow more comprehensive, integrating these complementary approaches will be essential to building a complete, functional, and high-resolution map of the cell surface proteome.
