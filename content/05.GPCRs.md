## 4. Insights into G protein-coupled receptors {.page_break_before}
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane proteins encoded in the human genome.
They translate extracellular cues, including hormones, neurotransmitters, volatile odorants or light into intracellular signaling via a conformational change catalyzing the exchange of GDP with GTP on associated heterotrimeric G proteins.
This leads to dissociation of the Gα subunit and initiation of downstream signaling cascades.
GPCR signaling is further modulated by specific GPCR kinases and β-arrestins, which mediate receptor desensitization, internalization and G-protein independent signaling.
The membrane association and low expression levels of GPCRs present significant challenges to MS-based proteomics, but recent advances have enabled the investigation of diverse aspects of GPCR signaling.

For instance, an enrichment tag was genetically fused to the gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor, a GPCR stimulating insulin release, to overcome limiting protein coverage.
This significantly increased the number of peptides measured from the receptor and enabled the identification of eight phosphorylation sites, mainly on the C-terminal receptor tail.
Quantification of phosphorylation states after stimulation with native GIP or the recently approved antidiabetic drug trizepatide identified upregulation at four sites.
Interestingly, a distinct fifth site was phosphorylated upon drug treatment, revealing unanticipated functional differences.[@DOI:10.1021/jacs.3c09078]

To study protein interactions and internalization dynamics of the μ-opioid receptor (μOR), researchers developed a novel spatial proximity-labeling workflow capable of inferring the subcellular localization of the receptor based on enrichment levels of spatial bystanders characteristic for specific organelles.
This approach was applied to stimulation with three distinct μOR agonists, identifying ligand-dependent receptor trafficking dynamics and proximal interaction networks.
For example, μOR stimulated with the synthetic DAMGO peptide exhibited much faster internalization kinetics compared with morphine treatment.
Additionally, EYA4 and KCTD13 were identified as novel network components modulating μOR signaling in a G-protein activation dependent manner. [@DOI:10.1038/s41589-024-01588-3]
